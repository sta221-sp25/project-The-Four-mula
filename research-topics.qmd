## Research Topic 1: AI-powered job market insights

One topic that captured our interest was the potential impact of Artificial Intelligence on the Job market. We all share an interest in Artificial Intelligence and its growing impact on our world, and are curious about how its influence may impact the economy and job market. People interested in this data set could be people entering the work force (us), or employers looking to optimize strategy.

**Potential Research Questions:**

1.  What factors influence an industryâ€™s likelihood of adopting AI technologies?

2.  Which job roles are at the highest risk of automation, and how does this risk vary by industry/salary?

3.  How can we quantify the risk associated with certain jobs?

We have some potential datasets that we are considering using at this time:

1.  AI Job Market Unveiled: Insights from 500 Data Points on Roles, Skills, and Salaries \[<https://www.gigasheet.com/sample-data/ai-job-market-insights>\]
